Development of ParFit has been supported in part by the Critical Materials 
Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S Department of Energy 
(DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing
Office, in part by the Chemical Sciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, 
Office of Science, DOE, and in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and 
Development Program, Fundamental Science Division of the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory.

This file contains the basic information to get started. Refer to Doc/Manual.pdf 
for more detailed information.

The main directory, ParFit, contains subdirectories: Data, Doc, ParFit, and 
Utils. The Data subdirectory contains the Engine, Gamess, and ParFit 
subdirectories. The Data/Engine directory contains the MM engine input, output,
and parameter files. The Data/Gamess directory contains the QM molecular 
information. The Data/ParFit subdirectory contains the energy profile and 
parameters at optimization intervals. The Doc subdirectory contains the ParFit 
user's manual (Manual.pdf/.doc). The ParFit subdirectory contains the main program
(ParFit.py) and example input files with root filename "scan_inp." ParFit is run from 
this directory using the command:

./Parfit.py

The Utils subdirectory contains an interactive ParFit input file generating 
program (PFinp.py) and template scripts that can rename multiple files 
(rename.py), automatically submit multiple jobs on a typical cluster (submit.py) 
and visualize the energy profile fit using matplotlib (QM_vs_MM_energies.py).

The input file format is as follows:

 Line/Block       Description
--------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
1 optional      |Two values, "mult", and the number of molecules for which to fit. 
                |Example: 
                |mult, Y
                |where Y is the the number of molecules to use for parameter
                |fitting, Y must be 1 or greater.
                |
2 to N          |the full/comp file type, the root filename, the atoms forming
                |the dihedral angle, and the triplet defining the dihedral 
                |angle.
                |
                |"full/comp QM data”: if "full" all the Gamess output files 
                |must be in the Data/Gamess subdirectory. If "comp,” a compact 
                |form of the QM data should be contained in one file in the 
                |/Data/Gamess subdirectory.
                |
                |"the root filename": the name without "X.log" where "X"
                |is the dihedral angle, if "full,” or the name without "scan,”
                |if "comp.”
                |
                |"the atoms forming the dihedral angle": four numbers defining
                |the dihedral angle
                |
                |"a triple defining the dihedral angle range": initial, final,
                |and angle step size.
                |
N + 1           |The full mmengine path.
                |
N + 2           |MM-type: "mm3" or "mmf94" 
                |
N + 3           |Optimization algorithm: "ga," "fmin," or "hybr"
                |
N + 4 to M      |The choice of the parameters to be optimized according to the
                |following format:
                |line number in add_MM3.prm or add_MMFF94.prm, 'c' or 'p', i.e.
                |"constant parameter" and "parameter to be optimized,"
                |respectively.
                |i.e, "15 c c p" means that within line 15, the first and second
                |parameters will remain constant and only the third parameter
                |will be optimized.
                |
M + 1 last line |Include "csv_on" to request comma separated value snapshot
                |files to be printed in the /Data/ParFit subdirectory. Each 
                |snapshot file contains the relative abinitio and MM energy for 
                |each dihedral angle. If the file is not needed, use "csv_off".

Sample inputs can be found in the ParFit subdirectory. The "dih_scan_inp_*_mm3" 
are sample inputs for MM3 and "dih_scan_inp_*_mmf94" for MMFF94. To use 
templates, copy to a different filename and change the mmengine path.

Development of ParFit has been supported in part by the Critical Materials 
Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub funded by the U.S Department of Energy 
(DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing
Office, in part by the Chemical Sciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences,

Development Program, Fundamental Science Division of the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory.

This file contains the basic information to get started. Refer to Doc/Manual.pdf 
for more detailed information.

The main directory, ParFit, contains subdirectories: Data, Doc, ParFit, and 
Utils. The Data subdirectory contains the Engine, Gamess, and ParFit 
subdirectories. The Data/Engine directory contains the Mengine input, output,
and parameter files. The Data/Gamess directory contains the QM molecular 
information. The Data/ParFit subdirectory contains the energy profile and 
parameters at optimization intervals. The Doc subdirectory contains the ParFit 
user's manual (Manual.pdf/.doc). The ParFit subdirectory contains the main program
(ParFit.py) and example input files with root filename "scan_inp." ParFit is run from 
this directory using the command:

./Parfit.py

The Utils subdirectory contains an interactive ParFit input file generating 
program (PFinp.py) and template scripts that can rename multiple files 
(rename.py), automatically submit multiple jobs on a typical cluster (submit.py) 
and visualize the energy profile fit using matplotlib (QM_vs_MM_energies.py).

The input file format for torsion angle parameter calculations is as follows:

 Line/Block       Description
---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Torsion angle parameter fitting:
---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 optional      | Two values, "mult", and the number of molecules for which to fit. 
                 | Example: 
                 | mult, Y
                 | where Y is the the number of molecules to use for parameter
                 | fitting, Y must be 1 or greater.
                 | 
 2 to N          | the full/comp file type, the root filename, the atoms forming
                 | the dihedral angle, the triplet defining the dihedral 
                 | angle, "diha" keyword. For comp file type, omit angle information.
                 | 
                 | "full/comp QM data”: if "full" all the Gamess output files 
                 | must be in the Data/Gamess subdirectory. If "comp,” a compact 
                 | form of the QM data should be contained in one file in the 
                 | /Data/Gamess subdirectory.
                 | 
                 | "the root filename": the name without "X.log" where "X"
                 | is the dihedral angle, if "full,” or the name without "scan,”
                 | if "comp.”
                 | 
                 | "the atoms forming the dihedral angle": four numbers defining
                 | the dihedral angle
                 |

                 | and angle step size.
                 |

                 | 
 N + 4 to M      | The choice of the parameters to be optimized according to the
                 | following format:
                 | line number in add_MM3.prm or add_MMFF94.prm, 'c' or 'p', i.e.
                 | "constant parameter" and "parameter to be optimized,"
                 | respectively.
                 | i.e, "15 c c p" means that within line 15, the first and second
                 | parameters will remain constant and only the third parameter
                 | will be optimized.
                 | 
 M + 1 last line | Include "csv_on" to request comma separated value snapshot
                 | files to be printed in the /Data/ParFit subdirectory. Each 
                 | snapshot file contains the relative abinitio and MM energy for 
                 | each dihedral angle. If the file is not needed, use "csv_off".

                 | 
 5               | The choice of the parameters to be optimized according to the
                 | following format:
                 | line number in add_MM3.prm or add_MMFF94.prm, 'c' or 'p', i.e.

		 | optimized.
                 | 
 6               | Include "csv_on" to request comma separated value files with a snapshot
                 | of the MM energies as compared to the QM energy at every 10th step in 
		 | the calculation. The files are printed to the /Data/ParFit subdirectory.
                 | To suppress printing the snapshots, use "csv_off".

Sample inputs can be found in the ParFit subdirectory. The "scan_inp_bond",
"scan_inp_angl", and "scan_inp" are sample inputs for bond length, bond angle, and
torsion angle, respectively. To use templates, copy to a different filename and change 
the Mengine path.

This file contains the basic information to get started. Refer to Doc/Manual.pdf 
for more detailed information.

The main directory, ParFit_0_9, contains subdirectories: ParFit, GAMESS, ENGINE,
Utils, and Doc. The ParFit subdirectory contains the Python scripts and example input
files with root name "dih_scan_inp," run ParFit from this directory 
using command: ./Parfit.py.  The GAMESS and ENGINE subdirectories 
contain the GAMESS and MM Engine input and output files, respectively. 
The ENGINE subdirectory also contains the coengine_mm3, coengine_mmff94 
and add_MM3.prm, add_MMFF94.prm files. The Utils subdirectory contains 
an interactive ParFit input generating program (PFinp.py) and template 
scripts that can rename multiple files (rename.py), automatically 
submit multiple jobs on a typical cluster (submit.py) and visualize fit 
using matplotlib (mp2_mm3_OPMMPH.py).

ParFit.py is the main script in the ParFit subdirectory. ParFit 
uses an input file (dih_scan_inp). One can generate an input file using
script PFinp.py with a descriptive name and copied to dih_scan_inp. 
The input file has a short and a long format. 

The short format is used for generating a sequence of GAMESS input files 
needed for the ab-initio constrained optimization
of a dihedral-angle energy scan. In this format the input file contains
just one comma-separated line of keywords. The first keyword is 
neccessarily "ginp", the second is "the file-name root", i.e. the name
without ".inp", the third is "the indices of the atoms forming the dihedral angle",
i.e. four numbers defining the dihedral angle and the fourth is "a triple
defining the dihedral angle range", i.e. initial, final, step size.

The long format consists of multiple lines:

 1st line: the full/comp file type, the file-name root, 
           the atoms forming the dihedral angle, and the triplet defining
           the dihedral atom: comma separated
 
           "the full/comp file type": if "full" all the GAMESS output file
           in the GAMESS directory, if "comp" the compact form of the same
           information stored in one file in the GAMESS directory

           "the file-name root": the name without "***.log" where "***" 
           is the dihedral angle (if "full") or the name without "scan"
           (if "comp")

           "the atoms forming the dihedral angle": four numbers defining
           the dihedral angle

           "a triple defining the dihedral angle range": initial, final, step 
 2nd line: the ENGINE path
 3rd line: MM-type: "mm3" or "mmf94"
 4th line: optimization agorithm: "ga" or "fmin"
 5th line until the end of the file (without the very last line): the choice of the 
 parameters to be optimized according to the following format:

 line number in add_MM3.prm or add_MMFF94.prm, 'c' stands for "constant" 
 and 'p' for a "parameter" to be optimized (for example, "c c p" means 
 that within the given line only the last parameter will be optimized) 
 

 Last line: "csv_on" if the Util/opt.csv file is requested
 or "csv_off" if not. The Util/opt.csv contains the dihedral angle,
 relative ab-initio energy and relative MM energy (comma separated).
 It can be visualized by either EXCELL or Util/mp2_mm3_*_csv.py 
 appropriately adapted for a given case.

The current input file is based on the OPMMPH example and the files 
needed for this example are supplied in the GAMESS subdirectory.

The "dih_scan_inp_*_mm3" are sample inputs for MM3 and "dih_scan_inp_*_mmf94" 
for MMFF94. (In order to use the samples one has to copy any of them 
to the default input name "dih_scan_inp".)

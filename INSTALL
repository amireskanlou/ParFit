Required:

 * Python 2.7.0 (or higher but not Python 3): 

If Python is not installed on your system, one can download 
the installation source from www.python.org. The website
contains detailed instructions on how to install. There are
pre-compiled binaries for selected systems. Python and most
of its libraries are open-source.

 * numpy, scipy, and Deap Python libraries:

One can check if numpy/scipy libraries are already installed on your system
by going into the interactive mode of Python (for example, by
typing "python" at the prompt of a Linux/Unix system) and attempting
"import numpy", "import pyevolve, and "import scipy". 
The source of numpy and scipy with detailed installation instructions 
can be downloded from www.scipy.org. There are pre-compiled binaries for 
selected systems. For the Deap library, visit https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deap

 * "Engine":

The BSD licensed MM ENGINE software from www.serenasoft.com has 
to be installed. The MM ENGINE source code is located in the ParFit/mmengine directory.
Update the variable engine_path = “” in the file: ParFit/_Engine.py to the location of
the MM ENGINE executable file.

Optional:

 * matplotlib Python library:

Matplotlib is a nice plotting facility within Python that is quite handy for
a visual comparison of target and fitted curves. One can check if it
is already available by "import matplotlib". The website for installation
is matlplotlib.org.

One can check if numpy/scipy libraries are already installed on your system
by going into the interactive mode of Python (for example, by
typing "python" at the prompt of a Linux/Unix system) and attempting
"import numpy", "import pyevolve, and "import scipy". 
The source of numpy and scipy with detailed installation instructions 
can be downloded from www.scipy.org. There are pre-compiled binaries for 
selected systems.

The proprietory MM ENGINE software from www.serenasoft.com has to be 
installed and the directory of installation has to be put into the variable 
engine_path in Fit/_Engine.py.

Optional:

 * matplotlib Python library:

Matplotlib is a nice plotting facility within Python that is quite handy for
a visual comparison of target and fitted curves. One can check if it
is already available by "import matplotlib". The website for installation
is matlplotlib.org.
